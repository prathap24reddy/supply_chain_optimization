## Project Overview
This project aims to optimize a global supply chain network by finding an optimal allocation of factories and distribution centers to meet fluctuating customer demands in a cost-effective manner. We utilize Monte Carlo Simulation and Linear Programming to create a robust network model that adapts to seasonal and unpredictable demand variations.

### Features
Demand Simulation: Simulate demand fluctuations across multiple global markets using a normal distribution.
Supply Chain Optimization: Implement a linear programming model to minimize total production and shipping costs.
Monte Carlo Scenario Analysis: Generate multiple demand scenarios and determine the most robust factory and distribution center allocations.
Automated Reporting: Generate PowerPoint reports and visualizations automatically, summarizing key insights.
### Technologies
Python: Primary language for data processing, simulations, and optimization.
NumPy & Pandas: Data handling and manipulation.
SciPy: Linear programming for optimization models.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization.
Python-pptx: PowerPoint report generation.
